#tuples are similar to list but are immutable.
#it is a built in data type that lets us create immutable sequence of values.
#tuples are defined using parentheses.
# tuple is always written with "," 
#EG: tup = (1,)

tup = (2, 1, 3, 1)
print(tup)
print(type(tup))
print(tup[0])
print(tup[2])

# slicing can also works in tuple.
#tup.index()
#tup.count()
